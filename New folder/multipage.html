      Indonesia, officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a country in Southeast Asia and Oceania,
      between the Indian and Pacific oceans. Comprising over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra,
      Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea, Indonesia is the world's largest
      archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres
      (735,358 square miles). With over 280 million people, Indonesia is the world's
      fourth-most-populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's
      most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population.
    </p>

      Indonesia operates as a presidential republic with an elected legislature and consists of 38
      provinces, nine of which have special autonomous status. Jakarta, the largest city, is the
      world's second-most-populous urban area. Indonesia shares land borders with Papua New Guinea,
      Timor-Leste, and East Malaysia, as well as maritime borders with Singapore, Peninsular
      Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India. Despite its large
      population and densely populated regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support
      one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity.

      The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at least the seventh
      century, when Sumatra's Srivijaya and later Java's Majapahit kingdoms engaged in commerce with
      entities from mainland China and the Indian subcontinent. Over the centuries, local rulers
      assimilated foreign influences, leading to the flourishing of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms.
      Sunni traders and Sufi scholars later brought Islam, and European powers fought one another to
      monopolise trade in the Spice Islands of Maluku during the Age of Discovery. Following three
      and a half centuries of Dutch colonialism, Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August
      1945. Since then, it has faced challenges such as separatism, corruption, and natural
      disasters, alongside democratisation and rapid economic growth.

      Indonesian society comprises hundreds of ethnic and linguistic groups, with Javanese being the
      largest. The nation's identity is unified under the motto Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, defined by a
      national language, cultural and religious pluralism, a history of colonialism, and rebellion
      against it. A newly industrialised country, Indonesia's economy ranks as the world's
      17th-largest by nominal GDP and the 7th-largest by PPP. As the world's third-largest democracy
      and a middle power in global affairs, the country is a member of several multilateral
      organisations, including the United Nations, World Trade Organization, G20, MIKTA, BRICS and a
      founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, East Asia
      Summit, APEC and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

    <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>

    <p>
      The name Indonesia derives from the Greek words Indos (Ἰνδός) and nesos (νῆσος), meaning
      "Indian islands". The name dates back to the 19th century, far predating the formation of
      independent Indonesia. In 1850, George Windsor Earl, an English ethnologist, proposed the
      terms Indunesians—and, his preference, Malayunesians—for the inhabitants of the "Indian
      Archipelago or Malay Archipelago". In the same publication, one of his students, James
      Richardson Logan, used Indonesia as a synonym for Indian Archipelago. Dutch academics writing
      in East Indies publications were reluctant to use Indonesia. They preferred Malay Archipelago
      (Dutch: Maleische Archipel); the Netherlands East Indies (Nederlandsch Oost Indië), popularly
      Indië; the East (de Oost); and Insulinde. After 1900, Indonesia became more common in academic
      circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups adopted it for political
      expression. Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularised the name through his book
      Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884 - 1894. The first native scholar to
      use the name was Ki Hajar Dewantara, who established a press bureau in the Netherlands,
      Indonesisch Pers-bureau, in 1913.

      The Indonesian archipelago has been inhabited since the time of Homo erectus or "Java Man,"
      with fossils dating back 2 million to 500,000 BCE. Fossils of Homo floresiensis, found on
      Flores, date around 700,000 to 60,000 BCE, while Homo sapiens arrived around 50,000 BCE.
      Sulawesi and Borneo are home to the world's oldest known cave paintings, dating back 40,000 to
      60,000 years, and megalithic sites such as western Java's Gunung Padang, Sulawesi's Lore
      Lindu, as well as Sumatra's Nias and Sumba reflect early human settlements and ceremonial
      practices. Around 2,000 BCE, Austronesian peoples began arriving in Southeast Asia from the
      island of Taiwan, gradually displacing native Melanesians to the far eastern part of the
      archipelago as they spread east, and would eventually form the majority of Indonesia's modern
      population. Favourable agricultural conditions and advancements like wet-field rice
      cultivation by the 8th century BCE enabled the growth of villages and kingdoms by the first
      century CE.
    </p>
    <p>
      The archipelago's strategic location fostered inter-island and international exchange with
      civilisations from the Indian subcontinent and mainland China, profoundly influencing
      Indonesian history and culture through trade. By the 7th century CE, the Srivijaya naval
      kingdom thrived on trade, adopting Hindu and Buddhist influences. The 8th to 10th centuries
      saw the rise and decline of the Buddhist Sailendra and Hindu Mataram dynasties, leaving
      monumental legacies like the Borobudur and Prambanan temples. After the failed Mongol invasion
      of Java in the late 13th century,the Hindu Majapahit kingdom rose to dominate much of the
      archipelago under Gajah Mada's leadership—a period often called the "Golden Age" of Indonesian
      history. Islam arrived in the 13th century in northern Sumatra, and following gradual adoption
      in other islands, it became the dominant religion in Java and Sumatra by the 16th century,
      blending with pre-existing traditions to form a distinct Islamic culture, particularly in
      Java.

      In 1512, Europeans began arriving in the archipelago, led by Portuguese traders under
      Francisco Serrão, to seek a monopoly of the lucrative spice trade in the Maluku Islands. Dutch
      and British traders soon followed, with the former establishing the Dutch East India Company
      (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie, VOC) in 1602, which eventually became the dominant European
      power for almost two centuries. After the VOC's dissolution in 1799 during the French
      Revolutionary Wars,the Dutch East Indies was established as a nationalised colony, marking the
      beginning of formal colonial rule by the Netherlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the next century and a half, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous, as they
      faced continuous rebellions from local leaders like Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam
      Bonjol in central Sumatra, Pattimura in Maluku, and fighters in Aceh. Dutch dominance only
      extended to Indonesia's modern boundaries in the early 20th century, with the establishment of
      Dutch posts in New Guinea.
    </p>
    <p>
      During World War II, the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Indies ended Dutch rule and
      encouraged Indonesia's independence movement. Only two days after Japan's surrender in August
      1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta issued the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, and they
      became the country's first president and vice-president, along with Sutan Sjahrir as Prime
      Minister. The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, prompting the start of
      Indonesia's war of independence against the Dutch. The conflict lasted until 1949, when the
      Dutch recognised Indonesian independence in the Dutch - Indonesian Round Table Conference
      following international pressure. Despite political, social, and sectarian divisions,
      Indonesians found unity in their fight for independence.
